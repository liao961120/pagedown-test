# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r pressure, fig.cap='(ref:caption)'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Width)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Species))
```

(ref:caption) Text refereces: `r Sys.Date()`




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
